        <h1>My hobbies</h1>
        <h2>These are some of the hobbies I love!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Debate</li>
            <p>Debating has been my passion for a long time and I love debating as a casual sport! It can be stress inducing sometimes, but I think it is fine, because it is naturally a sport you want to get good at!</p>
            <li>Playing piano</li>
            <p>I love discovering new songs and attempting to play them by ear. Although I usually end up searching for the scores to the songs anyways, I find it a fun challenge to try it out without any notes in the beginning. Anime songs are my favourite because they are rich in texture and harmony.</p>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <p>I am still beginning my coding journey, but I love learning about languages like Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript! It's the reason why I choose to learn computer science and continue my studies in Asia Pacific University despite not taking computer science stream in high school</p>
            <li>Knitting</li>
            <p>I started knitting as a means of escape from my phone as I realized that I was slowly beginning to get addicted to my phone. It is a relaxing hobby and allows me to create something without being so intensely focussed on it.</p>
            <li>Crocheting</li>
            <p>I learnt how to crochet shortly after learning how to knit. Crocheting started because my other friends were doing it and it's a lot more forgiving than knitting. I am able to make a lot of things with crocheting such as a beanie, water bottle holder, granny square pouch and much more! I hope to one day sell them because they are worth a lot in the market.</p>
            <li>Studying</li>
            <p>As nerdy as it sounds, studying fires me up because it means I learn newer things. I love learning science subjects, especially chemistry, but without the exams. They are fun because they allow me to delve deeper into how the world works and how does it stay that way.</p>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <p>Gaming is one of my favourite pastimes. I play League of Legends most of the time. It gets depressing sometimes but gives me the adrenaline rush I sometimes crave. It makes me sound like an addict, but I promise you, I am not! I also love the classics like Need For Speed:Most Wanted Black Edition. It's very fun and gives me that nice adrenaline rush at the end of a very tiring day.</p>
